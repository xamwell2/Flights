# Development and Strategy

## Project Overview

The project's goal is to create a flight schedule application using JavaScript, emphasizing a separation of concerns architecture. This method involves breaking down the codebase into distinct modules, each responsible for specific tasks, such as components, CSS, logic, handlers, etc.

## Development Approach

- Separation of Concerns**: Divide the project into modules, each handling a different aspect of functionality.
  
- Modular Design**: Group related functionalities within modules to enhance reusability and ease of maintenance.
  
- Code Organization**: Maintain a clear folder structure to organize various module types.
  
- Testing**: Implement unit tests for each module to ensure functionality and detect potential bugs early in development.
  
- Version Control**: Employ a version control system like Git to track changes effectively.

## Module Types

Tasks for each user story will fall into different categories:

- `type: components`: Responsible for rendering UI components.
- `type: css`: Managing styles and layout.
- `type: logic`: Handling business logic and data manipulation.
- `type: handlers`: Managing user interactions and event handling.
- Additional types can be introduced as required by project needs.

## Conclusion

Through adhering to the separation of concerns approach and employing modular design principles, our aim is to develop a well-structured and maintainable flight schedule application in JavaScript.
